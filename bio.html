<h1>About me</h1>
<h2>Research interest</h2>
I study a range of processes related to ice–ocean interactions, including iceberg calving, submarine ice melt,
  and physical oceanography in glacial fjords. One of my primary tools is acoustical oceanography — a method that
  uses naturally generated underwater sound to better understand physical processes in seawater and at its boundaries.
  I have developed a technique to quantify calving fluxes from the underwater noise produced by icebergs collapsing into
  the ocean. My current work focuses on treating glacial fjords as natural laboratories for ice–ocean interactions,
  using passive acoustics, optical techniques, moored observing systems, and marine robotics.
