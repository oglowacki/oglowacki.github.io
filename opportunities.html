<h1>Opportunities</h1>
I am always interested in working with motivated PhD students and postdoctoral researchers who want to understand
  how glaciers and icebergs interact with the ocean — how ice melts, breaks apart, and generates waves, and how the
  ocean responds to these processes. If you enjoy working with real data from field observations and linking physics with
  environmental change, feel free to get in touch.
